# FishTelPrac
Early dev/noodling repo for working with data from BARD, esp. Spring Run Chinook data from the San Joaquin & steelhead from the Sacramento

Currently has no 'Data' directory, as initial file sizes were too large for basic Github.

Current stage of work: adapt working C++ LCS & constructor tool to work with Rcpp i/o.
