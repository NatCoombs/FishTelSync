# FishTelPrac
Early dev/noodling repo for working with data from BARD, esp. Spring Run Chinook data from the San Joaquin & steelhead from the Sacramento

Currently has no 'Data' directory, as initial file sizes were too large for basic Github.

Note to self: need to re-pull the first steelhead file due to mismanagement issues w/ Git.
