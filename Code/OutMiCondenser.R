# Function OutMiCondenser

# OutMiCondenser takes a salmonid release data frame and returns a version where individual receiver has been stripped, 
# and instead the data has been pared down to each detection and location pairing.  OutMiCondenser should ONLY be used where data
# is bad enough that OutMiVel cannot be used directly
